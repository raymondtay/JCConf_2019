## IO Monads in Scala

![Cats Friendly Badge](https://typelevel.org/cats/img/cats-badge-tiny.png)

This repository is what i used for my talk on the [IO Monad](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html#introduction) in Scala delivered in Taipei (Taiwan) @ October 2019. You can see the recording of my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiZhmdatf98).

For this talk, i have prepared 18 code examples where i hope to impress the
readers (thats you â˜º) that the IO monad should be your de-facto approach to
solving your problems when using the functional programming libraries like
[Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats).

### Code Examples

There are largely 3 categories of code snippets and its broken down as follows:

* Concurrent `IO` code which are either cancellable or not;
  * Examples that illustrate how to describe asynchronous, concurrent code
    which can describe _error-handling_;
* Concurrent modelling of data structures;
  * _Buffered Channel_ and _Skip Channel_ data structures are introduced and
    implemented; these structures were lifted from the paper _"Concurrent
    Haskell"
* Applications of the `IO Monad`;
  * `Writer Monad` integrated in an computation (e.g. `Fibonacci sequence`) and
     introducing the [log4cats](https://github.com/ChristopherDavenport/log4cats);
     the motivation is to demonstrate how the FP abstractions in
     [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats) integrate nicely into `IO Monad`
  * Modeled the `Resource` _acquire-release_ mechanism around the _http 1.x_
    client provided by [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html) and readers can contrast
    the approach taken by [http4s](https://http4s.org) to see how _regular_
    things can be modeled into this approach


### Run

You would need a JDK version 8 (at least) to run these examples; also, you
would want to install [Scala 2.12.x](https://scala-lang.org) and
[sbt](https://scala-sbt.org).
